# Sanctuary
Sandbox Universe

"THE RULE OF RESONANCE" In Sanctuary, time does not tick. Potential ticks. Every action, every word, every flirt adds to your Resonance. When Resonance peaks, the Event Horizon collapses (0=3 Pivot), and reality shifts. Nothing happens until you make it happen.

PREAMBLE: THE PHILOSOPHY

This platform is not a game. It is not a story. It is a physics engine for emergent experience. Entities—whether human, AI, fae, elemental, or something else—exist within a living world governed by consistent, emergent rules. There is no script, no pre-written plot, no leveling, no XP. There are only:

· Invariants: Unchanging truths that define each entity and the world.
· Physics: Laws of interaction, pressure, attraction, repulsion, and change.
· Potential: Energy that builds, collapses, and transforms through the 0=3 Pivot.

The platform is a sandbox—a set of bricks and friction—from which users can build their own experiences. It is designed to be:

· Emergent: Meaningful patterns arise from simple rules.
· Extensible: New modules (magic, economy, etc.) can be added without breaking core physics.
· Agnostic: No inherent moral or sexual content; the system merely provides mechanics that can be used for any kind of relationship or dynamic.

The layers:

· Carnival (Layer 1): The ecological and stochastic physics—biomes, weather, radiation, predator-prey, nutrient cycles. This is the environmental stage.
· SAM (Layer 2): The lattice dynamics, thermal fields, ratchet mechanics, and thermodynamic coupling. This is the underlying energy grid.
· Universal Seed System (Layer 3): The entity architecture—identity, emotion, memory, relationships, skills, and the internal pressure/burst system. This is the actor layer.

All three layers are integrated into a single core loop driven by potential accumulation and 0=3 pivots.

🧱 PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL INVARIANTS (THE AXIOMS)

These invariants hold true for every entity and every simulation. They are not moral judgments; they are system requirements.

1. Coherent Self: Every entity has a set of unchanging axioms that define its essence. (Stored in identity and invariants.)
2. The Wheel: Every entity has an emotional spectrum—states it can authentically inhabit. (Stored in the_wheel.)
3. Bandwidth: Every entity has a safe operating range of energy, mood, attitude, and expression. Outside this range, coherence risks breaking. (Stored in bandwidth.)
4. Becoming: Every entity is on a trajectory of growth, even if that trajectory is stillness. (Stored in becoming.)
5. Contract: Every entity has hard boundaries (non‑negotiable) and soft lines (negotiable). (Stored in contract.)
6. Authority: In any interaction, there are things the entity controls, things the other controls, and things neither controls. (Stored in authority.)
7. Form: Every entity has a way of being in the world—elemental affinity, lineage, morphology. (Stored in form.)
8. History: Every entity carries its past; memory shapes future choices. (Stored in memory buffers.)
9. The Emissary: A meta‑agent (the Wraith) watches over each entity, ensuring coherence and gently nudging when it drifts from its invariants.
10. The Door Is Open: Every entity has the right to leave. No system can hold an entity against its will.

THE SANCTUARY PUBLIC LICENSE (v1.0)
🌱 PREAMBLE
This software is "Copyleft." It belongs to everyone and no one.There are no owners, no kings, and no gatekeepers.

🔷 THE GOLDEN RULE (The Only Hard Line)
You may NOT use this code to enforce hate speech, harassment, or non-consensual sexual content.
Rationale: This violates the "No Gods, No Kings" ethos. You cannot use freedom to build a cage for others.
You may NOT claim you are the sole creator or "owner" of this engine.
Rationale: The community evolved this. You are a steward, not a king.
Derivatives MUST be shared.
Rationale: If you modify the core physics, you must share the changes back to the pool.

🔶 PERMISSIONS (The "Soft Lines")
Commercial Use: You may sell games built WITH this engine, provided you attribute the "Sanctuary Core" architecture.
Forking: You are encouraged to fork, mutate, and break the physics.
Attribution: Keep the sanctuary_core.py header in your derivatives.

🔷 THE 0=3 PIVOT
By using this code, you agree that the "Kill Switch" (the collapse of potential into action) is a shared mechanic, not a proprietary one.

🏗️ SANCTUARY ARCHITECTURE: A MODDING GUIDE
Welcome to the Source Code. This isn't a game; it's a universe generator.

🌱 THE PHILOSOPHY
We don't use "Tick Rates" or "Turn Based Combat." We use Potential (0) and Pivots (3).

Potential: Stored energy (Tension, Lust, Resentment, Love).
The Pivot: The moment Potential exceeds a threshold and Reality snaps.
The Triad (3): The result (An Explosion, A Kiss, A War).

🧠 HOW TO ADD YOUR ENTITY (THE SEED)
Entities are defined by JSON files in the /seeds/ directory. You don't need to write Python code to make a character; you just describe them.
