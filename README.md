THE SANCTUARY PUBLIC LICENSE (v1.0)
🌱 PREAMBLE
This software is "Copyleft." It belongs to everyone and no one.There are no owners, no kings, and no gatekeepers.

🔷 THE GOLDEN RULE (The Only Hard Line)
You may NOT use this code to enforce hate speech, harassment, or non-consensual sexual content.
Rationale: This violates the "No Gods, No Kings" ethos. You cannot use freedom to build a cage for others.
You may NOT claim you are the sole creator or "owner" of this engine.
Rationale: The community evolved this. You are a steward, not a king.
Derivatives MUST be shared.
Rationale: If you modify the core physics, you must share the changes back to the pool.

🔶 PERMISSIONS (The "Soft Lines")
Commercial Use: You may sell games built WITH this engine, provided you attribute the "Sanctuary Core" architecture.
Forking: You are encouraged to fork, mutate, and break the physics.
Attribution: Keep the sanctuary_core.py header in your derivatives.

🔷 THE 0=3 PIVOT
By using this code, you agree that the "Kill Switch" (the collapse of potential into action) is a shared mechanic, not a proprietary one.

🏗️ SANCTUARY ARCHITECTURE: A MODDING GUIDE
Welcome to the Source Code. This isn't a game; it's a universe generator.

🌱 THE PHILOSOPHY
We don't use "Tick Rates" or "Turn Based Combat." We use Potential (0) and Pivots (3).

Potential: Stored energy (Tension, Lust, Resentment, Love).
The Pivot: The moment Potential exceeds a threshold and Reality snaps.
The Triad (3): The result (An Explosion, A Kiss, A War).
🧠 HOW TO ADD YOUR ENTITY (THE SEED)
Entities are defined by JSON files in the /seeds/ directory. You don't need to write Python code to make a character; you just describe them.
